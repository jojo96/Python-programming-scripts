A Hadamard pattern is a black and white pattern defined recursively: A 1x1 Hadamard pattern is a single black square. 2Nx2N Hadamard pattern is obtained by aligning 4 copies of the NxN pattern in the form of a 2x2 grid and then inverting the colors of all the squares in the lower right NxN copy.

#Yoga Pose detection using Deep learning

This work focuses on using Computer Vision to analyze a person doing Suryanamaskara by detecting their pose. The user experience (UX) and learning can be improved immensely by capturing the userâ€™s actual performance through video and applying computer vision techniques to retrieve the various poses for further analysis. Similar applications can be made with respect to dance steps which will help in better practice.
