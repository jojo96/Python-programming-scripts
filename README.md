#Yoga Pose detection using Deep learning

This work focuses on using Computer Vision to analyze a person doing Suryanamaskara by detecting their pose. The user experience (UX) and learning can be improved immensely by capturing the userâ€™s actual performance through video and applying computer vision techniques to retrieve the various poses for further analysis. Similar applications can be made with respect to dance steps which will help in better practice.
